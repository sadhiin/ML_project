An end-to-end fashion recommendation system deployed on Streamlit, leveraging the ResNet50 pre-trained model for feature extraction and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for similarity matching. The platform allows users to upload a preferred clothing image, and the model subsequently recommends similar available products from the e-commerce site. The system aims to enhance the online shopping experience by providing personalized and accurate fashion recommendations.
